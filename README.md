# Hoti-s-World

    Complete overhaul of Fallout 4 and everything except the perk system, to bring it closer to MY ideal version of Fallout, criticism is encouraged Hotiraripha's World, or Hoti's World for short, is a nearly complete overhaul of every system of Fallout 4, adding everything that I PERSONALLY would have wanted fallout to be. From enemies being more varied and intelligent, to adding dozens of weapon mods, Hoti's World is a re-imagining of the game. It is not a yet another hardcore modlist, but something for everyone who wants what I'd say is a slightly tough list. It contains REAL.AI and Untethered REAL.AI, so expect things to be different.

CHECK THE INSTRUCTIONS, YOU NEED TO READ EVERYTHING!



List of mods (https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/hotis-world-v050)

No perk system overhauls in this version as be exceptional has proven to be troublesome.

Everything is preconfigured for the end user, you just need to select F4SE and
play. If you want the upscaler mod I will leave instructions on how to
make it work but you will need to remove the ENB

I do not have many testers, as I have recently started working on this. There
may be bugs, extensive testing is needed, but I wanted to get as many
people to help as possible with this. This modlist has been tested on a
very high end system but ideally you should have:

MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
RAM
16GB DDR4 3000Mhz
CPU
Ryzen 3600 and above
Intel 9th gen, 6 Core with hyperthreading or more
GPU
RX 5700 and above on AMD's side
RTX 2060 Super and above on Nvidia's or 1080 Ti.
SSD REQUIRED 180GB FREE NEEDED

RECOMMENDED:
RAM
32gb 3200mhz
CPU
Ryzen 3600 and above
Intel 9th gen, 6 Core with hyperthreading or more
GPU
RTX 2080 Super or higher
RX 5700 xt/6700 or higher
SSD REQUIRED 180GB FREE NEEDED


Out of the box the game is configured with NAC X but ideally I would love you
to try it with REACTOR ENB (https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57321), as it provides a visual overhaul that is to MY liking.


Instructions:

Before doing anything, if you are using a fresh installation of FO4 you need to launch the fo4 launcher first, select your graphical settings and then close the launcher, after that,launch mo2 and start F4SE.
The game may take long to load once starting a new game, or seem like it is not loading at all, proceed to spam the keys 'space, tab. T. and F' after a bit it will load.

You will need to download Wabbajack from here: Wabbajack (https://www.wabbajack.org/)
video instructions here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9jDnjSRqOE)

Then, create a folder called Wabbajack anywhere BUT protected folders such as
Documents, Program Files or any other pre-created Windows folders,
Create it somewhere such as C:\Wabbajack\.
Put Wabbajack.exe in said folder and start it.
Once it has finished installing, select install from disk, and select the .wabbajack file you got from Nexus.
Select a folder to install the modlist into following the same rules for Wabbajack folder. You can set a downloads folder to another folder if you like.
Once it has all finished installing, start the ModOrganizer.exe from the install folder and select F4SE from the drop menu next to PLAY button, and you will be able to play.
