PRE REQUIREMENTS :
Fresh Installation of Fallout 4, outside of program files or any windows protected folder, make sure to add Mod Organizer 2, Steam and your game folders to Windows' exclusion list, otherwise you may run into issues.

POST INSTALLATION: 
You will have to select your graphical settings in Mod Organizer 2's own Fallout 4 Launcher instance, after selecting your settings, you can launch F4SE.

Whilst in game, remove the tactical reload keyword from vanilla weapons, so that you are able to reload, to do this, bring up the ECO quick modification menu in MCM, first option once the game is paused, also, DO NOT use survival mode difficulty, as it is not supported by Hotisworld, instead, configure your own difficulty with advanced needs 76.

If you encounter the infinite loading bug upon starting a new game, press these keys in any order until the game loads, for some reason there is an invisible check or option you end up selecting by pressing these keys: tab, space, t and enter, and the game will load

After loading and creating your character, you will get a prompt asking you if you have any mods that need loading, click yes and wait.

Any questions you may have, critiscm feedback or inclusion proposals, feel free to join the discord and tell me.
